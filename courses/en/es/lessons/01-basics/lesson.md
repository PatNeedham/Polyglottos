## Grammar

### Formal vs Informal Address

Spanish has two levels of formality when addressing people:

**Informal (tú):**

- Used with friends, family, children, and peers
- Example: "¿Cómo te llamas?" (What's your name?)

**Formal (usted):**

- Used with strangers, older people, or in professional settings
- Example: "¿Cómo se llama usted?" (What's your name?)

### Time-based Greetings

Spanish greetings change based on the time of day:

- **Buenos días** - morning until around 12 PM
- **Buenas tardes** - afternoon until around 6-7 PM
- **Buenas noches** - evening/night after 6-7 PM

## Practice

### Exercise 1: Match the Greeting

Practice matching Spanish greetings with their English meanings.

### Exercise 2: Formal or Informal?

Decide whether to use formal or informal greetings in different scenarios.

## Cultural Notes

In Spanish-speaking cultures, greetings are very important and are often accompanied by physical contact like handshakes, hugs, or cheek kisses depending on the region and relationship between people. It's considered polite to greet everyone when entering a room.

## Summary

Key takeaways from this lesson:

- **Hola** is the universal informal greeting
- Time-based greetings (buenos días, buenas tardes, buenas noches) are more formal
- Use **tú** forms with friends and **usted** forms in formal situations
- **Me llamo** + your name is how you introduce yourself

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll expand on introductions by learning how to say where you're from and asking others about their origin. We'll also practice the verb "ser" (to be) in basic contexts.
